Implementation:
-> A 3x3 Memristor Crossbar array.
-> 3x Inputs (Assume analog sensor data)
-> 3x Weights of Neural Network (Each coloumn has a weight.

-> High resistance at the sink point


How it works?

1- Each input puts in some voltage between 0V-5V
2- The weights set the threshold of Voltage divider (kind of..)
3- The sensor voltage acts as source of the Voltage Divider.
4- If Weight < Source:
	i-	Current flows towards Weight source due to high resistance on the sink side AND lower Voltage level on the weight side.
	ii-	Voltage drop occurs between that memristor and Sink resistance.
5- If Source < weight:
	i-	Current flows from Weight towards Source
	ii-	This condition is not recommended as it may damage the sensor etc. A diode in forward BIAS can help block this flow. In that case, Higher Voltage will appear at that node. 
	(Such system requires to be optimized for certain output. Multiple Op Amp comparators should be used after each output to get the perfect result.)
	An Example Calculation:
	W1 = 1.5V
	W2 = 0.5V
	W3 = 2.5V
	
	S1 = 5V
	S2 = 5V
	S3 = 5V
	
	O1 = 1.5V
	O2 = 0.5V
	O3 = 2.5V
	
	
	S1 = 5V
	S2 = 1.8V
	S3 = 3.3V
	
	O1 = 1.5V
	O2 = 0.5V
	O3 = 2.5V
	
	
	
	


=> The voltage level between a memristor and its sink resistance be used in application
	e.g to activate CMOS or to trigger an OP-AMP comparator etc.
